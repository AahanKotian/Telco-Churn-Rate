# Telco-Churn-Rate

The assignment aimed to compare various classification models to predict customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. Expecting logistic regression to excel due to its reputation for probability prediction and classification, the study evaluated seven models and selected RandomForestClassifier for its superior performance on both training and testing sets. Despite logistic regression's sensitivity to feature selection, both models achieved comparable accuracy and AUC scores. The study noted potential noise in the dataset, impacting model performance during hyperparameter tuning and suggesting the need for further preprocessing, such as assessing numerical feature distributions. Moreover, it suggested utilizing a dummy classifier for baseline comparison in future analyses. Ultimately, while both models effectively predicted churn, logistic regression demonstrated efficiency with fewer steps, supporting its reputation as a versatile model for classification tasks.
